# Food quality prediction in cold storage warehouse


### Problem Statement:
To increase the life span of the food and prevent it from detoriation, it will be stored in cold storage warehouses. These warehouses became smart by using IIOT (Industrial internet of things) which helps an organization to increase energy savings, efficiency, and operational insight by instrumenting cold storage warehouse with intelligent LED lighting and smart sensor-based Industrial IoT (IIoT) solutions. Here comes the problem, as these IIoT is more concentrating on the infrastructure and environment, there is still a chance that foods which are being stored in these warehouses may loose its freshness and quality because of many factors like fluctuation in food temparatures, types of food packaging and many factors. 


### Use Case and implementation
By using an IOT device like a sensor which can report the health and quality of the food like its temparatures, state and more information, we can analyze the trend about quality of the food and predict the future trend about food quality and health.

For this use case, three food categories(Chicken, Fries and Ice cream) are taken which are to be mainatianed in different temparature limits to prevent food from being detoriated. Using Machine Learning techniques, for these three food categories, identified the past trends about food quality and predicted future food quality trends.

By knowing the future trends, we can look for spikes and anamolies about the food quality and preventive measures can be taken from food being detoriated. Also we can build a reporting mechanism which can send high proirity emails and messages to floor associates and managers regarding the upcoming food quality spikes.
