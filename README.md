# Food quality prediction on cold storage warehouse


### Problem Statement:
To increase the life span of the food, it will be stored in cold storage warehouses. These warehouses became smart by using IIOT (Industrial internet of things) which helps an organization to increase energy savings, efficiency, and operational insight by instrumenting cold storage warehouse with intelligent LED lighting and smart sensor-based Industrial IoT (IIoT) solutions. Here comes the problem, as these IIoT is more concentrating on the infrastructure and environment, there is still a chance that foods which are being stored in the warehouses may loose its freshness and quality because of many factors like fluctuation in food temparatures, types of food packaging and so many factors. 


### Use Case
By using an IOT device like a sensor which can report the health and quality of the food like its temparatures, state and more information, we can analyze the trend in quality of the food and can predict the future trend on food quality and health.

For this three food categories(Chicken, Fries and Ice cream) are taken which are to be mainatianed in different temparature limits to prevent food from being detoriation. Using Machine Learning techniques, identified the past trends about the food quality and predicted the food quality into future.
